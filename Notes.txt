Release Notes\n\n

Release 5.0.0.0\n
Math Wizard caan no instantaniously solve any quadratic of any size (binomial-quadratics only)! Math wizard is aplso now compatible with doubles (eg 1.0, 3.0, 8.0), and will output in doubles. These changes only apply to binomial tools.\n\n
Release 4.0.0.0\n
We added compatibility for subtraction (negative integers). Because we added negative integers, the amount of work in multiplied by alot. math wizard will be 4, or 8 times slower, depending on the function performed. We also added Work Faker (beta version). Work faker fakes work for your math problem. Note: Prepare at least 20 sheets of letter size paper for printing.\n\n
Release 3.0.0.0\n\n
Math Wizard has become a lot faster with optimization technology. We removed the quadratic validators, and polynomial validators. To validate an expression, just solve it and if it isn't valid, it will show in the output. But we also added a general tab, in which you can generate a random quadratic.\n\n
Release 2.0.0.0\n
You can now turn quadratics into back into their binomial or trinomial forms. Note, to turn back a quadratic into its trinomial form takes a lot longer.\n\n
