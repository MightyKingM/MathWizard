Release 4.0.0.0<br><br>
We added compatibility for subtraction (negative integers).

Math Wizard has become a lot faster with optimization technology. We removed the quadratic validator, and polynomial validators. To validate an expression, just solve it and if it isn't valid, it will show in the output. But we also added a general tab, in which you can generate a random quadratic.<br><br>
