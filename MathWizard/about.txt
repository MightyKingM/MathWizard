Math wizard is a computer program that can convert quadratics to polynomials (vice versa), and perform related functions. This program might be able to help you on your algebra homework, or help you finish any problems. It can be really handy at times.
  
  Limitations; This program can only hadle binomials, and trinomials. The program will request a parsable fomat (mentioned below), and might take a while to do certain calculations. Note, the calculations assume you eecute 1 line of code every 1ms. Also, you cannot involve any form of subtraction.
  
Time for a calculation (binomials)
Refer to the equation ax^2+bx+c
the amount of time(seconds) it will take is the largest number (out of b and c)^2 and divided by 1000;

Time for a calculation (trinomials)
Refer to the equation ax^3+bx^2+cx+d
the abount of time(seconds) it will take is the larges number (out of b,c, and d)^3 and divided by 1000;
